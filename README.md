## Introduction

Welcome to MindSpace — a website I created to support mental health and wellbeing. My goal was to build a calm, welcoming space where users can find helpful resources, tips, and ways to reach out if they need support. I wanted to make something easy to use, comforting, and supportive for anyone who visits. This project is part of my journey learning web development — from planning and wireframing to coding with HTML and CSS.

## Project Outline

MindSpace is a small but meaningful step I took to help people understand and care for their mental health. I designed it to be friendly and easy to use, offering useful information and resources without overwhelming visitors.

I aimed to create a space where anyone — whether they’re just curious or looking for support — can find helpful content that feels approachable and trustworthy. The design adapts smoothly to phones, tablets, and computers, so users can access it anytime, anywhere. Accessibility was also a priority for me to ensure everyone can navigate the site comfortably.

## Key Objectives

- Make the website simple and calming so users feel at ease  
- Present information clearly so it’s easy to find and understand  
- Ensure the site works great on all devices, from phones to desktops  
- Use colors and visuals that create a peaceful, welcoming vibe  
- Add small interactive touches that help users feel connected and supported

## UX Design

### User Stories

- As someone seeking mental health support, I want to easily find trustworthy information, so I feel informed and reassured.  
- As a first-time visitor, I want the website to be simple and straightforward, so I can quickly understand what it offers without feeling overwhelmed.

## Wireframes

To plan the layout of MindSpace, I created wireframes showing how the website would look on different screen sizes. These helped me ensure the site would be clear, calm, and easy to use whether someone visits on their phone, tablet, or computer.
